<h3>What sets a professional trader apart from others?</h3>
<h4>Where and how a professional trader opens a trade?</h4>

<p>
  While millions of people participate in forex trading, only a few achieve success. Success is influenced by <br>
  factors like theoretical and practical knowledge, as well as risk management. However, one characteristic that </br>
  distinguishes a professional trader is discipline, according to Trader.org. This quality enables them to adhere </br>
  to the rules they establish based on their theoretical knowledge and practical experience, leading to consistent
  success.
